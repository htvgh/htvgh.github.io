 <h2>How to stop Corruption!</h2>
 <b< <i> Anti-corruption (or anticorruption) comprises activities that oppose or inhibit corruption. Just as corruption takes many forms, anti-corruption efforts vary in scope and in strategy.[1] A general distinction between preventive and reactive measures is sometimes drawn. In such framework, investigative authorities and their attempts to unveil corrupt practices would be considered reactive, while education on the negative impact of corruption, or firm-internal compliance programs are classified as the former.</b> </i>
 
 <h2>How did Corruption come about?</h2>
 
 
 <b> <i> Early history

Among the earliest documented anti-corruption efforts include the code of Hammurabi, dated to around 1754 BC.
The code of Hammurabi (c.â€‰1754 BC), the Great Edict of Horemheb (c.1300 BC), and the Arthasastra (2nd century BC)[2] are among the earliest written proofs of anti-corruption efforts. All of those early texts are condemning bribes in order to influence the decision by civil servants, especially in the judicial sector.[3] During the time of the Roman Empire, corruption was also inhibited, such as by a decree issued by emperor Constantine I in 331.[4]

In ancient times, moral principles based on religious beliefs were common, as several major religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, and Taoism condemn corrupt conduct in their respective religious texts.[5] The described legal and moral stances were exclusively addressing bribery but were not concerned with other aspects that are considered corruption in the 21st century. Embezzlement, cronyism, nepotism, and other strategies of gaining public assets by office holders were not yet constructed as unlawful or immoral, as positions of power were regarded a personal possession rather than an entrusted function. With the popularization of the concept of public interest and the development of a professional bureaucracy in the 19th century offices became perceived as trusteeships instead of property of the office holder, leading to legislation against and a negative perception of those additional forms of corruption.[6] Especially in diplomacy and for international trade purposes, corruption remained a generally accepted phenomenon of the political and economic life throughout the 19th and big parts of the 20th century.[7]
